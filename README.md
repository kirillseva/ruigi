ruigi: the R package that could
===========

This repository is based off a basic template for R packages that already includes
Travis and [covr](http://github.com/jimhester/covr) integration.

Do not forget to set those up at https://travis-ci.org/ and https://coveralls.io/

But soon it will be much more than that!
